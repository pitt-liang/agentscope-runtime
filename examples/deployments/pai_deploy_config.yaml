# PAI Deployment Configuration Example
# Used with:
#   agentscope deploy pai <source> --config pai_deploy_config.yaml
#
# Structure:
# - context: Where to deploy (region / workspace)
# - spec:    What to deploy (code / resources / network / permissions / env)

context:
  # PAI workspace ID (tenant scope).
  # Can be overridden by env var: PAI_WORKSPACE_ID
  workspace_id: "12345"

  # Region code where the PAI Service are located.
  # Example: cn-hangzhou, cn-shanghai, etc.
  region: "cn-hangzhou"

spec:
  # Service name (required).
  # Recommended: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphen; must be unique within the region.
  name: "my-agent-service"

  code:
    # Path to your project root directory (relative to the config file, unless your CLI defines otherwise).
    # This directory will be packaged and uploaded for deployment.
    source_dir: "example_proj"

    # Entrypoint file within source_dir.
    # If omitted, the system may try common defaults: app.py, agent.py, main.py
    entrypoint: "agent.py"

  # Optional: assign the service into an existing service group for management/permissioning.
  # If not set, the service will be created without a group (or use platform default behavior).
  service_group_name: "my-service-group"

  resources:
    # Number of service instances (replicas).
    instance_count: 1

    # Resource selection mode (mutually exclusive):
    # - public:   deploy on public resource pool, specify instance_type
    # - resource: deploy to a dedicated EAS resource group, specify resource_id + cpu + memory
    # - quota:    deploy using a PAI quota, specify quota_id + cpu + memory
    type: "public" # options: public, resource, quota

    # --- public mode ---
    # ECS instance type used in public resource pool.
    # Required when type=public. Ignored/invalid for other types.
    instance_type: "ecs.c6.large"

    # --- resource mode ---
    # Dedicated EAS resource group ID. Required when type=resource.
    # resource_id: "eas-r-xxxxx"

    # --- quota mode ---
    # Quota ID. Required when type=quota.
    # quota_id: "quota-xxxxxxxx"

    # CPU cores and memory for type=resource/type=quota.
    # For type=public, these are typically ignored (or should be omitted to avoid confusion).
    # cpu: 2
    # memory: 4096

  vpc_config:
    # Optional: VPC networking configuration.
    # If provided, the service will
    # If omitted, the platform default network (public) will be used.
    vpc_id: "vpc-xxxxx"
    vswitch_id: "vsw-xxxxx"
    security_group_id: "sg-xxxxx"

  permission:
    # Optional: RAM role ARN assumed by the service runtime.
    # If omitted, the default PAI RAM role for the workspace will be used.
    ram_role_arn: "acs:ram::xxxxx:role/xxxxx"

  observability:
    # Enable tracing / telemetry collection.
    enable_trace: true

  storage:
    # Optional: OSS working directory for build artifacts / runtime files.
    # If omitted, the workspace default OSS path will be used.
    work_dir: "oss://my-bucket/agent-workspace/"

  env:
    # Environment variables injected into the running container/service.
    DASHSCOPE_API_KEY: "your-dashscope-api-key"
